# 🎵 MUSAIX.COM - CPANEL DEPLOYMENT METHOD

## 🚨 SSH Connection Issues - Using cPanel Instead

SSH authentication is having issues, so let's use the **cPanel File Manager method** which is more reliable:

## 🚀 STEP-BY-STEP CPANEL DEPLOYMENT

### **Step 1: Login to HostGator cPanel**
1. Go to your HostGator customer portal
2. Login with your credentials (Energy2024$)
3. Access cPanel for your musaix.com domain

### **Step 2: Upload Scripts Package**
1. In cPanel, click **"File Manager"**
2. Navigate to your **home directory** (not public_html)
3. Click **"Upload"** button
4. Select `server-scripts.tar.gz` from `/home/sterl/wp/server-scripts.tar.gz`
5. Click **"Go Back to File Manager"** after upload

### **Step 3: Extract Scripts**
1. Right-click on `server-scripts.tar.gz`
2. Select **"Extract"**
3. Choose extraction location (home directory is fine)
4. Click **"Extract Files"**
5. You should now see a `scripts/` folder

### **Step 4: Set Permissions**
1. Right-click on the `scripts` folder
2. Select **"Change Permissions"**
3. Set to **755** for the folder
4. Go into the scripts folder
5. Select all `.sh` files
6. Right-click → **"Change Permissions"** → Set to **755**

### **Step 5: Test Via cPanel Terminal (if available)**
Some cPanel installations have a **Terminal** option:
1. Look for **"Terminal"** in cPanel
2. If available, click it to open web-based terminal
3. Run: `cd ~/public_html && ~/scripts/health-check-musaix.sh`

## 🔧 ALTERNATIVE: MANUAL SCRIPT CREATION IN CPANEL

If the upload doesn't work, create scripts manually:

### **Create Health Check Script:**
1. In File Manager, go to home directory
2. Create new folder: `scripts`
3. Inside scripts folder, click **"+ File"**
4. Name: `health-check-musaix.sh`
5. Right-click → **"Code Editor"**
6. Paste this content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "🎵 MUSAIX.COM - HEALTH CHECK"
cd ~/public_html || exit 1
echo "✅ WordPress location: $(pwd)"
if [ -f wp-config.php ]; then
    echo "✅ WordPress configuration found"
    DB_NAME=$(grep "DB_NAME" wp-config.php | cut -d "'" -f 4)
    echo "🗄️ Database: $DB_NAME"
else
    echo "❌ wp-config.php not found"
fi
echo "🔌 Checking plugins..."
if [ -d wp-content/plugins ]; then
    echo "📦 Installed plugins:"
    ls wp-content/plugins/
else
    echo "❌ Plugins directory not found"
fi
echo "🎨 Checking themes..."
if [ -d wp-content/themes ]; then
    echo "🎨 Installed themes:"
    ls wp-content/themes/
else
    echo "❌ Themes directory not found"
fi
echo "✅ Health check complete - Your Musaix Pro site is operational!"
```

7. Save the file
8. Right-click → **"Change Permissions"** → **755**
