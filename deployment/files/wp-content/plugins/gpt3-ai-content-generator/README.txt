While a Migration Tool is available, I strongly recommend **not migrating old data** and instead starting with a fresh setup.

The new version includes powerful features like **OpenAI Vector Store** support, which is faster and easier to manage.

If you were previously using external services like **Pinecone** or **Qdrant**, you might not need them anymore.

The new built-in OpenAI Vector Store is optimized for performance and fully integrated with AI Power 2.3+.

If you still need to migrate old data please check the [migration tool](https://docs.aipower.org/docs/getting-started/migration-from-legacy)

Please check our [documentation](https://docs.aipower.org/) for the new features.
