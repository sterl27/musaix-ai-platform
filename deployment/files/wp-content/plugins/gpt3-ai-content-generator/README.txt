== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to buy credits from you? =  
No. AIP works with your **own API key** from AI providers like OpenAI, Google Gemini, etc. You pay them directly for usage.

We support **OpenAI** (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, DALL·E 3, etc.), **Google** (Gemini, Imagen), **Microsoft Azure OpenAI**, **OpenRouter**, **DeepSeek**, **Ollama** and **Replicate**.

= Can I train the AI on my own content? =  
Yes. Use the **Train** module to index posts, pages, WooCommerce products, PDFs, or uploaded files into a **vector store**. Then link that knowledge base to your Chatbot or Forms.

= How do I limit AI usage for visitors or members? =  
The **Token Management** add-on lets you set role-based or guest usage limits for Chat, Forms, Images, etc. Limits can reset daily, weekly, monthly, or never.

= Can I monetize my AI tools? =  
Yes. Sell **token packages** via WooCommerce. Tokens are consumed when users access AI features.

= What makes AIP different from other AI plugins? =  
AIP is **all-in-one** — instead of installing separate plugins for chatbots, content writing, AI forms, and WooCommerce AI, you get them all in one optimized toolkit with centralized settings.

This is a major update.

While a Migration Tool is available, I strongly recommend **not migrating old data** and instead starting with a fresh setup.

The new version includes powerful features like **OpenAI Vector Store** support, which is faster and easier to manage.

If you were previously using external services like **Pinecone** or **Qdrant**, you might not need them anymore.

The new built-in OpenAI Vector Store is optimized for performance and fully integrated with AI Power 2.3+.

If you still need to migrate old data please check the [migration tool](https://docs.aipower.org/docs/getting-started/migration-from-legacy)

Please check our [documentation](https://docs.aipower.org/) for the new features.
