# 🔐 MUSAIX.COM AUTHENTICATION & DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION

## 🚨 SSH TEMPORARILY BLOCKED

The server is blocking SSH connections due to "too many authentication failures" - this is a security feature that will reset in a few minutes.

## 🔑 AUTHENTICATION CLARIFICATION

You have multiple passwords for different services:

### **SSH/HostGator Server Access:**
- **Username**: acaptade
- **Host**: 192.254.189.236
- **Password**: Your **HostGator cPanel/hosting account password** (likely Energy2024$)

### **WordPress Admin Access:**
- **URL**: https://musaix.com/wp-admin
- **Username**: S73RL
- **Password**: Bl@ckbirdSr71 (this is for WordPress only, not SSH)

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS

### **OPTION 1: Wait & Retry SSH (15-30 minutes)**
```bash
# Wait for SSH block to clear, then try:
ssh acaptade@192.254.189.236
# Use your HostGator hosting password (Energy2024$)
```

### **OPTION 2: HostGator cPanel File Manager (RECOMMENDED NOW)**

Since SSH is temporarily blocked, use cPanel:

#### **Step-by-Step cPanel Upload:**
1. **Login to HostGator Customer Portal**
   - Use your HostGator account credentials
   - Navigate to cPanel for musaix.com

2. **Open File Manager**
   - Click "File Manager" in cPanel
   - Navigate to your home directory (not public_html)

3. **Upload Scripts Package**
   - Click "Upload" button
   - Select: `/home/sterl/wp/server-scripts.tar.gz`
   - Wait for upload to complete

4. **Extract Files**
   - Right-click on `server-scripts.tar.gz`
   - Select "Extract"
   - Extract to home directory
   - You'll see a new `scripts/` folder

5. **Set Permissions**
   - Right-click `scripts` folder → Permissions → 755
   - Go inside scripts folder
   - Select all .sh files → Permissions → 755

6. **Test via cPanel Terminal** (if available)
   - Look for "Terminal" in cPanel tools
   - If available, run: `~/scripts/health-check-musaix.sh`

### **OPTION 3: Manual Script Creation in cPanel**

Create a simple health check script directly in cPanel:

1. **File Manager** → Home directory
2. **Create folder**: `scripts`
3. **New file**: `health-check.sh`
4. **Edit file** with this content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== MUSAIX.COM HEALTH CHECK ==="
cd ~/public_html
echo "WordPress Location: $(pwd)"
echo "WordPress Status:"
if [ -f wp-config.php ]; then
    echo "✅ WordPress found"
    echo "Database: $(grep DB_NAME wp-config.php | cut -d "'" -f 4)"
else
    echo "❌ WordPress not found"
fi
echo "Plugins: $(ls wp-content/plugins 2>/dev/null | wc -l) installed"
echo "Themes: $(ls wp-content/themes 2>/dev/null | wc -l) installed"
echo "=== HEALTH CHECK COMPLETE ==="
```

5. **Save** and set permissions to 755
