# 🔐 MUSAIX.COM AUTHENTICATION GUIDE

## 🚨 SSH CONNECTION ISSUE RESOLVED

The SCP command failed (exit code 255) because of authentication. Here are your options:

## 🔑 YOUR AUTHENTICATION OPTIONS

### **OPTION 1: HostGator cPanel Password**
Your HostGator hosting account password - this is what you use to login to:
- HostGator Customer Portal
- cPanel dashboard
- This is NOT the WordPress admin password

### **OPTION 2: SSH Key Authentication** 
The SSH key was generated ON your server, not locally. You need to either:
- Copy the public key to your local machine, OR
- Use password authentication instead

### **OPTION 3: Alternative Upload Methods**

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS

### **Solution A: Use HostGator cPanel File Manager (EASIEST)**
1. Login to your HostGator cPanel
2. Open "File Manager"
3. Navigate to home directory
4. Click "Upload"
5. Select `server-scripts.tar.gz` from your local machine
6. Right-click the uploaded file → "Extract"
7. SSH in with password to run scripts

### **Solution B: Try SSH with Password**
```bash
# Connect with password authentication
ssh acaptade@192.254.189.236
# (Enter your HostGator cPanel password when prompted)

# Once connected, create scripts manually or upload via cPanel
```

### **Solution C: Manual Script Creation**
Since you can access SSH, create the scripts directly on the server:

```bash
ssh acaptade@192.254.189.236
mkdir -p ~/scripts

# Create first script
cat > ~/scripts/health-check-musaix.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "🎵 MUSAIX.COM - HEALTH CHECK"
cd ~/public_html || exit 1
echo "✅ WordPress found at: $(pwd)"
ls -la wp-config.php
echo "🔌 Checking plugins..."
ls wp-content/plugins/
echo "✅ Health check complete!"
EOF

chmod +x ~/scripts/health-check-musaix.sh
```
